Hostellites is a web-based platform developed to streamline the interaction between students and hostel owners. The website provides a user-friendly interface for students to book rooms, view services, and manage their hostel stay, while enabling hostel owners to manage room availability, bookings, and user information.

Folder Structure and File Description
Root-Level Files and Functionalities:

HTML Files:

about, contact, home, service, thankyou: These files are likely the core pages of the website, providing essential information about the hostel, services offered, and a contact form for inquiries.
booking, login, new_user, signup, prelogin: These files handle user authentication and booking functionalities, allowing new users to sign up, existing users to log in, and both to book hostel rooms.
room, list_room, team: These pages might be dedicated to listing available rooms, providing details about each room, and possibly introducing the hostel management team.
PHP Files (Identified by the Purple Icon):

These files likely handle back-end logic for the website. Examples include:
functions, l_function, r_functions: General functions that manage data processing, database queries, and user session management.
logout, r_logout: Functions to handle user logout and session termination.
connection, l_connection, r_connection: Handle database connections, ensuring secure data exchange between the website and the database.
payments: Manages payment processing, potentially integrating with third-party payment gateways.
prelogin: Manages the login process, possibly handling tasks like session creation or verification of user credentials.
Directories:

css, scss, img, js:

These directories contain the stylesheets, images, and JavaScript files that define the website's front-end design and interactive behavior.
css and scss: Contain Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and SASS files for styling the website. The use of SASS indicates that the website employs a preprocessor to write cleaner and more modular CSS.
img: Stores images used across the website, such as banners, room photos, and logos.
js: Contains JavaScript files responsible for adding dynamic behavior to the website, such as form validation, user interactions, and possibly AJAX calls for asynchronous data loading.
lib:

This directory likely houses external libraries or custom modules that the website depends on. It may include third-party JavaScript libraries (like jQuery, Bootstrap), CSS frameworks, or utility functions.
Front-End (Client-Side)
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web pages. The website uses a standard layout with multiple pages dedicated to different functionalities like booking, user authentication, and information dissemination.
CSS/SCSS: Controls the visual presentation of the website, ensuring a consistent and appealing design. The use of SCSS indicates that styles are modular, maintainable, and possibly dynamic, allowing for easier updates and theming.
JavaScript: Enhances user experience by enabling dynamic interactions, such as form validations, page transitions, and AJAX for smoother navigation without full page reloads.
Back-End (Server-Side)
PHP: Handles the server-side logic, including user authentication, database interactions, session management, and payment processing. PHP files execute on the server and generate dynamic content for the front-end to display.
Database Connection: The presence of connection-related PHP files suggests that the website connects to a database (likely MySQL or MariaDB) to store user information, booking records, room details, and possibly payment transactions.
Security: The site likely implements secure session handling, data sanitization, and possibly CSRF protection (though specific security mechanisms would need to be verified in the code).
Core Functionalities
User Authentication: The website supports user registration (signup), login (login), and logout (logout), enabling secure access to user-specific features.
Room Booking: Students can browse available rooms (list_room), view details (room), and complete bookings (booking).
Payment Processing: The payments file suggests integration with payment gateways for processing room booking fees or other charges.
Contact and Information: The contact page allows users to reach out to hostel management, while about and service pages provide essential information about the hostel and its offerings.
Team Management: The team page may introduce the hostel staff or management team, enhancing transparency and trust.
Conclusion
The "Hostellites" website is a well-structured platform aimed at providing a seamless experience for both students and hostel owners. Its architecture reflects a blend of modern web development practices, including the use of PHP for server-side processing, SCSS for maintainable styling, and JavaScript for dynamic client-side interactions. The site is likely equipped to handle core functionalities like user authentication, room booking, payment processing, and more, making it a robust solution for hostel management.
